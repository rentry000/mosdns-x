## Mosdns-x PR (Privacy & Resilience)

Mosdns-x is a high-performance DNS forwarder written in Go. It features a plugin pipeline architecture, allowing users to customize DNS processing logic for any specific use case.

This version is a fork based on [pmkol/mosdns-x](https://github.com/pmkol/mosdns-x) and incorporates significant improvements and commits from [BaeKey/mosdns-x](https://github.com/BaeKey/mosdns-x), with a primary focus on privacy and connection resilience.

**Supported Protocols (Inbound & Outbound):**

* UDP and TCP
* DNS over TLS (DoT)
* DNS over QUIC (DoQ)
* DNS over HTTP/2 (DoH)
* DNS over HTTP/3 (DoH3)

### New Features and Enhancements

**Resilience (Connection & Performance)**

* Improved reconnection speed after server restarts for all encrypted DNS protocols.
* **DoH3/DoQ:** Reconnection time reduced from 3-5 seconds to under 100ms.
* **DoH/DoT:** Reconnection time reduced from 500-700ms to 200-300ms.
* Persistent session keys stored in `key/.mosdns_stateless_reset.key` enable 0-RTT and TLS Session Resumption across restarts.
* Added a `/health` endpoint for lightweight uptime monitoring.

**Privacy and Security**

* Disabled client IP logging to ensure user anonymity, even when logs are active.
* Added `allowed_sni` validation to filter unauthorized scanners and bots during the TLS handshake. Blocked requests are excluded from logs.
* Automated redirection of non-DNS traffic (any path other than `/dns-query`) to a custom landing page.
* DNS responses limited to a maximum of 2 IP addresses per query to reduce payload overhead.
